# noisier
A noise generator for MacOS

Once upon a time there was a random audio noise generator for Mac called Noise by Blackhole Media, but it was PowerPC only
and it was remade as [Noisy](https://github.com/jonshea/Noisy) for Intel-based Macs.

This is a Swift-based attempt at a similar software.
